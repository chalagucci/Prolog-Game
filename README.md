Prolog Adventure Game

1. There is a gate between the fork in the path and the mountaintop. The gate is a
separate location; that is, the player must move from at (you, fork) to at (you, gate) and
then to at (you, mountaintop).
2. To move forward through the gate, the player must first unlock it with a key.
3. The key is somewhere in the maze. The player must find it and explicitly pick it up
4. If the player tries to pass through the gate while still holding the key, he or she is killed
by lightning. (To get the treasure, the player must first open the gate, then put down the key and then pass through)
